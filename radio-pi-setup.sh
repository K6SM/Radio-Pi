# radio-pi-setup.sh  version 0.5.3  (2026-09-30)
#
# Sets up a Raspberry Pi as the radio-end computer of a remote amateur radio
# station.
#
# It installs and configures, so that all three come up at boot:
#
#   * Hamlib's rigctld, driving the transceiver you select from the list of
#     radios your Hamlib build supports;
#   * a Mumble server, tuned for a radio link rather than for a chat room;
#   * a headless Mumble client at the radio, feeding receiver audio into the
#     link and the link's audio into the transmitter.
#
# It also leaves the Pi reachable over SSH, usable on a directly attached
# screen and keyboard for Emacs in the terminal, in console mode with no
# desktop, and tuned to keep latency low while otherwise drawing as little
# power as it can.
#
# Written for the K6SM remote station: ham.el / ham-remote.el and the Emacs
# QSO Logger at the operator's end, this Pi at the radio's end.
#
# Run it as root, on a console or over SSH, from a file -- not piped from
# curl, because it asks questions:
#
#     sudo bash radio-pi-setup.sh
#
# It is safe to run again: everything it does is written to be repeatable, so
# re-running after a software upgrade re-applies the configuration without
# installing second copies of anything or resetting a password you changed.
#
#     sudo bash radio-pi-setup.sh --unattended     # re-run with saved answers
#
# License: same terms as the K6SM ham.el package.

# -E: the error trap below also fires inside functions, so a failure anywhere
# is reported rather than ending the script without a word.

#
# Keeps the radio-end Pi on the network, and writes down why it fell off.
#
# Every INTERVAL seconds it asks whether the Wi-Fi is really working: is the
# interface there, is it joined to a network, does it have an address, does
# the gateway answer. After CONFIRM failures in a row it treats it as an
# outage and does two things, in this order:
#
#   1. Records the evidence, BEFORE touching anything: the kernel's log, the
#      network manager's log, the link and address state, whether the network
#      can still be seen at all. Recovery destroys most of this, so it comes
#      first. One file per outage, in /var/log/ham-radio-pi/wifi-incidents/.
#
#   2. Recovers, in escalating steps, stopping at the first that works:
#        reassociate         ask the network manager to rejoin
#        restart-interface   Wi-Fi radio off and on again
#        reload-driver       unload and reload the Wi-Fi driver, which
#                            restarts its firmware
#        reboot              last resort, rate limited, and never within the
#                            first half hour after a boot
#
# Which step works is itself the diagnosis: a network manager that had given
# up is fixed by the first, a driver whose firmware has hung only by the
# third. `ham-radio-pi-wifiwatch --report` counts them.
#
# Settings are read from /etc/ham-radio-pi/wifiwatch.conf.

# Trusting the server's certificate
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A Mumble server generates its own certificate, which no authority has
# signed, so a client meeting it for the first time raises a modal dialog
# asking whether to trust it. At the operator's end somebody clicks yes. At
# the radio there is nobody, and no screen: the dialog opens on a display
# that exists only inside Xvfb, Mumble waits on it forever, and all that can
# be seen from outside is a client that runs and never connects.
#
# A client that already holds the server's certificate digest skips the
# question (ServerHandler::setSslErrors calls proceedAnyway), so the digest
# is put there in advance. It is the SHA-1 of the DER form of the
# certificate, lower case hex, which is what Mumble compares against.

# Every database Mumble might be using, one per line.
#
# Guessing this path is how an earlier version of this script went wrong.
# Mumble tries its base path, then Qt's DataLocation, then ~/.config/Mumble,
# then the home directory, and uses the first that already holds a database.
# Qt's DataLocation is <organization>/<application>, and Mumble sets both to
# "Mumble", so it is ~/.local/share/Mumble/Mumble -- one level deeper than it
# looks. Write to the wrong file and every step reports success while Mumble
# reads a different one.
#
# So find what is really there rather than predict it, and write to all of
# them. A path is only chosen when there is no database at all, and then it
# is the one Qt would pick.

   better answer if this station is not on your own LAN.

$C_HEAD== Before you transmit ==$C_OFF

   Enable the transceiver's own transmit timeout. Nothing at the operator's

   Set the transmit audio level with the rig's ALC meter, not by ear: bring
   it up in alsamixer until ALC just begins to move, and stop there.

   Changed something? Edit $CONF_FILE and run
   sudo bash $0 --unattended
